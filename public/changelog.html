            This version focuses on adding delegated access as the main feature. Most calls needed to be re-worked to
            support this.


            <br><br>


            <ul>
                <li>Delegated Access - Add tenants which have access delegated via another tenant. Allows the ability to
                    easily add multiple tenants via one API key.</li>
                <li>Quota List - List quote elements per tenant, sorted by percentage consumed. Search also available.
                </li>
                <li>Improved retry logic with exponential backoff. Allows for more tenants to be added.</li>
                <li>Batching of API calls. Currently only getStats is batched, as this seemed to be one of the heaviest
                    calls on to the XC platform.</li>
                <li>Collapse All and Expand All added to Overview.</li>
                <li>Minor bug fixes and general logic updates.</li>
            </ul>
